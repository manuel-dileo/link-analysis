edition = {2nd},
abstract = {Written by leading authorities in database and Web technologies, this book is essential
reading for students and practitioners alike. The popularity of the Web and Internet
commerce provides many extremely large datasets from which information can be gleaned
by data mining. This book focuses on practical algorithms that have been used to solve
key problems in data mining and can be applied successfully to even the largest datasets.
It begins with a discussion of the map-reduce framework, an important tool for parallelizing
algorithms automatically. The authors explain the tricks of locality-sensitive hashing
and stream processing algorithms for mining data that arrives too fast for exhaustive
processing. Other chapters cover the PageRank idea and related tricks for organizing
the Web, the problems of finding frequent itemsets and clustering. This second edition
includes new and extended coverage on social networks, machine learning and dimensionality
reduction.}

abstract = {How do real graphs evolve over time? What are normal growth patterns in social, technological,
and information networks? Many studies have discovered patterns in static graphs,
identifying properties in a single snapshot of a large network or in a very small
number of snapshots; these include heavy tails for in- and out-degree distributions,
communities, small-world phenomena, and others. However, given the lack of information
about network evolution over long periods, it has been hard to convert these findings
into statements about trends over time.Here we study a wide range of real graphs,
and we observe some surprising phenomena. First, most of these graphs densify over
time with the number of edges growing superlinearly in the number of nodes. Second,
the average distance between nodes often shrinks over time in contrast to the conventional
wisdom that such distance parameters should increase slowly as a function of the number
of nodes (like O(log n) or O(log(log n)).Existing graph generation models do not exhibit
these types of behavior even at a qualitative level. We provide a new graph generator,
based on a forest fire spreading process that has a simple, intuitive justification,
requires very few parameters (like the flammability of nodes), and produces graphs
exhibiting the full range of properties observed both in prior work and in the present
study.We also notice that the forest fire model exhibits a sharp transition between
sparse graphs and graphs that are densifying. Graphs with decreasing distance between
the nodes are generated around this transition point.Last, we analyze the connection
between the temporal evolution of the degree distribution and densification of a graph.
We find that the two are fundamentally related. We also observe that real networks
exhibit this type of relation between densification and the degree distribution.},
